CS122 Assignment 3 - Join Optimization - Design Document
========================================================

A:  Logistics
-------------

A1.  List your team name and the people who worked on this assignment.

     BBB

     Ryan Batterman
     Alex Bello
     Ronnel Boettcher

A2.  Specify the tag name and commit-hash of the Git version you are
     submitting for your assignment.  (You can list the commit hashes
     of your repository tags with this command:  git show-ref --tags)

     Tag name:     <tag>
     Commit hash:  <hash>

A3.  Specify any late tokens you are applying to this assignment, or
     "none" if no late tokens.

     none

A4.  Briefly describe what parts of the assignment each teammate focused on.

B:  Generating Optimal Joins
----------------------------

B1.  Briefly describe how you generate an "optimal" access to a base table.

B2.  Briefly describe how you decide when it is acceptable to push
     conjuncts down through an outer join.

B3.  The planner in this assignment is still somewhat limited; for example,
     we can't push conjuncts down into subqueries.  Using the stores schema,
     write an example SQL query that includes a subquery, where it would be
     beneficial to push a conjunct down into the subquery.  (Your planner
     obviously doesn't need to perform this optimization.)

B4.  Enumerate the situations where you call prepare() on plans being
     generated.  Since this operation is somewhat expensive, do you
     see any ways to reduce the number of times you call prepare() in
     your implementation?

B5.  In what situations can you end up with unused conjuncts after
     planning joins.  Illustrate by giving an example SQL statement
     that would have unused conjuncts after join planning, again using
     the stores schema.  Then, describe a strategy for where/how these
     left-over conjuncts should be applied in the plan.

C:  Costing SQL Queries
-----------------------

After you have loaded the stores-28K.sql data and have analyzed all of
the tables in that schema, run the following explain operations and paste
the output from your planner (excluding debug output!).

If there is anything unusual or non-obvious about your output, feel free
to write explanatory notes after your output.

C1.  EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM cities WHERE population > 5000000;

Explain Plan:
    Project[values:  [CITIES.CITY_ID, CITIES.CITY_NAME, CITIES.POPULATION, CITIES.STATE_ID]] cost=[tuples=254.0, tupSize=23.8, cpuCost=508.0, blockIOs=1]
        FileScan[table:  CITIES, pred:  CITIES.POPULATION > 5000000 AND CITIES.POPULATION > 5000000] cost=[tuples=254.0, tupSize=23.8, cpuCost=254.0, blockIOs=1]

Estimated 254.000000 tuples with average size 23.787401
Estimated number of block IOs:  1



*------------------------------------------------------------------------*
C2.  EXPLAIN SELECT store_id FROM stores, cities 
            WHERE stores.city_id = cities.city_id AND
            cities.population > 1000000;

            FileScan[table:  STORES] cost=[tuples=2000.0, tupSize=13.0, cpuCost=2000.0, blockIOs=4]

C3.  EXPLAIN SELECT store_id FROM stores JOIN
        (SELECT city_id FROM cities WHERE population > 1000000) AS big_cities 
        ON stores.city_id = big_cities.city_id;

E:  Extra Credit [OPTIONAL]
---------------------------

If you implemented any extra-credit tasks for this assignment, describe
them here.  The description should be like this, with stuff in "<>" replaced.
(The value i starts at 1 and increments...)

E<i>:  <one-line description>

     <brief summary of what you did, including the specific classes that
     we should look at for your implementation>

     <brief summary of test-cases that demonstrate/exercise your extra work>

F:  Feedback [OPTIONAL]
-----------------------

These questions are optional, and they obviously won't affect your grade
in any way (including if you hate everything about the assignment and
databases in general, or Donnie and the TAs in particular).

NOTE:  If you wish to give anonymous feedback, a similar survey will be
       made available on the Moodle.  

F1.  How many hours total did your team spend on this assignment?
     (That is, the sum of each teammate's time spent on the assignment.)

F2.  What parts of the assignment were most time-consuming?

F3.  Which parts of the assignment did you particularly enjoy?

F4.  Which parts did you particularly dislike?

F5.  Do you have any suggestions for how future versions of the
     assignment can be improved?
