CS122 Assignment 6 - Write-Ahead Logging - Design Document
=============================================================

A:  Logistics
-------------

A1.  List your team name and the people who worked on this assignment.

     bbb

     Ryan Batterman
     Aleksander Bello
     Ronnel Boettcher

A2.  Specify the tag name and commit-hash of the Git version you are
     submitting for your assignment.  (You can list the commit hashes
     of your repository tags with this command:  git show-ref --tags)

     Tag name:     <tag>
     Commit hash:  <hash>

A3.  Specify any late tokens you are applying to this assignment, or
     "none" if no late tokens.

     none

A4.  Briefly describe what parts of the assignment each teammate focused on.

     Aleksander Bello worked on beforeWriteDirtyPages, forceWAL, rollbacks,
     as well as redo and undo processing.
     Ryan Batterman was too busy this week (work in other classes piled up),
     so his teammates agreed to pick up his portion of work. He'll be 
     making up for it on the next set.
     Ronnel Boettcher worked on forceWAL, debugging, as well as implementing
     performRedo and performUndo functions.


B:  Extra Credit [OPTIONAL]
---------------------------

If you implemented any extra-credit tasks for this assignment, describe
them here.  The description should be like this, with stuff in "<>" replaced.
(The value i starts at 1 and increments...)

B<i>:  <one-line description>

     <brief summary of what you did, including the specific classes that
     we should look at for your implementation>

     <brief summary of test-cases that demonstrate/exercise your extra work>

C:  Feedback [OPTIONAL]
-----------------------

These questions are optional, and they obviously won't affect your grade
in any way (including if you hate everything about the assignment and
databases in general, or Donnie and the TAs in particular).

NOTE:  If you wish to give anonymous feedback, a similar survey will be
       made available on the Moodle.  

C1.  How many hours total did your team spend on this assignment?
     (That is, the sum of each teammate's time spent on the assignment.)

C2.  What parts of the assignment were most time-consuming?

C3.  Which parts of the assignment did you particularly enjoy?

C4.  Which parts did you particularly dislike?

C5.  Do you have any suggestions for how future versions of the
     assignment can be improved?
